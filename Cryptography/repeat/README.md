this challenge was straight forward we were given this two files 

https://github.com/rbih-boulanouar/UofTCTF-2024/blob/753df7cc346ecaa9161b2cb8769cac4ae2be83fb/Cryptography/repeat/gen.py#L1-L13

and

https://github.com/rbih-boulanouar/UofTCTF-2024/blob/753df7cc346ecaa9161b2cb8769cac4ae2be83fb/Cryptography/repeat/flag.enc#L1

it is basic xor operation on the flag and the 8 bytes xor_key in line 5

we also know that the flag starts with `UofCTF{` so we have the first 8 bytes of flag.

as you know The XOR operation is reversible, so key  = first 8 bytes of the encrypted flag âŠ• `UofCTF{` bytes

using tools like [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) you can find the flag : `UofTCTF{X0r_IZ_r3v3RS1Bl3_w17H_kN0wN_P141n73X7}`
